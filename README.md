# Wells-Fargo-Analytics-Challenge
This project is based on how we can come up with innovative solutions by analyzing the dataset that was given to us. After thorough Exploratory Data Analysis, I had proposed a design concept that Wells Fargo can use in their systems. This design concept can solve and bring back the customers that they would have let go unknowingly.
